**Claptrap** is a messaging intercepting tool that allows developers and testers to verify that messaging features are working in their application. Currently Claptrap mimics an SMTP server to test email sending. The next logical step is produce clones of popular SMS gateway API's in order to test text messaging features.

A small library is currently in the works in order to add Claptrap to your regular JUnit tests.
